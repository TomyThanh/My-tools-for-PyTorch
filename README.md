This repository contains a comprehensive collection of custom Python functions to support machine learning and deep learning projects. These functions were developed and optimized over the course of many of my own projects. They cover typical steps in the ML workflow:

üì¶ Data Preprocessing
Text Cleansing & Tokenization
Functions for removing special characters, lowercasing, stop word filtering, etc.

Data Normalization & Scaling
Support for MinMax or standard scaling of numeric features.

Train/Test Splitting
Automated splitting of datasets including randomization.

üèóÔ∏è Model Creation & Training
Keras & TensorFlow Model Builder
Modularized functions for creating typical architectures (MLP, CNN, RNN).

Custom Training Loops (PyTorch & TF)
Custom training loops for more control over learning rate, logging, etc.

üìä Visualization
Loss and Accuracy Plots
Automatic visualization of training progress.

Confusion Matrix & Metrics
Display classification performance in a comprehensible manner.

ü§ñ Special Tools
Custom Tokenizers
E.g., CharTokenizer for character-based processing.

Text Generation with GPT-2
Wrappers and helper functions for text collection and further processing.

Model Export & Load
Functions for secure storage and reuse of trained models.

Etc.
